# 1. print Function 
""" A built-in function that displays messages on the output screen to communicate with users.  """

"""
Let’s explain it in a different, simpler way using a real-life analogy.

Think of a function like a kitchen machine:
   1 You give it some ingredients (inputs).
   2 It does something (processes the ingredients)
   3 Sometimes it gives you something back (output).

For example, print() is like a speaker in your kitchen: you give it a message, and it announces it aloud. It doesn’t return anything—you just hear it.
    print("Hello, Tahir!")  # The speaker says the message

    Output:
    Hello, Tahir!


Now, if you create your own function:

    def add_numbers(a, b):  # kitchen machine for adding
    return a + b        # gives the sum as output

    result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # use the machine
    print(result)               # show the output

    Output:
    8

    Here, add_numbers is your own machine.
    a and b are ingredients (inputs).
    return a + b is the result it gives back.
    Then we use print() to show it to the user.

So the key idea is:
Functions = machines that do tasks.

print() = a function that shows messages to the user. """

# Syntax of print function:

# print Function
"""     
print("Hello, World!") 
print("Hello", "World")
