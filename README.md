## 🧩 Projects (Main Focus)

### 🎬 Project 1: Movies Data Analysis Pipeline

**Goal:** Understand how data engineering tools work together in practice.

**Tools Used:**

* SQL
* Pandas
* Databricks

**Dataset:**

* Movies dataset

**What you’ll see here:**

* Loading data into a data platform
* Exploring and processing data using Pandas
* Writing SQL queries on real data
* Understanding how Databricks fits into data engineering workflows

This project is about **how things work behind the scenes**, not just results.

More projects will be added step by step as I grow in this field.

## 📚 Learning Phase (Foundation)

Before starting projects, I followed a **structured learning approach** to understand what Data Engineering really is.

If you are new to Data Engineering or this repository, start here:

👉 **[Learning Phase → Exploration](https://github.com/Tahir-Zaman-23DS14/Data-Engineering/tree/main/Learning%20Phase/%230%20Exploration)**

This section explains:

* What Data Engineering actually involves
* Real responsibilities of a data engineer
* Tools, mindset, and workflow

It helps build the **right foundation** before moving to projects.
